  D2. Progress report
   
    At this point you must have acquired and installed all the software and hardware needed and should have
    made some progress in developing the code needed. You need to include proof that you have acquired
    the board and any hardware needed. The report will describe the status of the project. You should also
    mention which attribute of your project you propose to evaluate. You must evaluate at least one of these.
      
      Limitations like resolution, accuracy or response time
      Potential security holes and how they can be mitigated
      Power consumption estimates of the device
      Cost and marketability of a device based on your project

  First draft of written response:
  
  We have acquired the Raspberry Pi aswell as the webcam for it. We forgot that the Raspberry pi requires a micro SD
  card for the OS as well as storage, so that has just arrived. All we need to install is Rasbian and openCV. We have
  located some helpful tutorials that guide us through using openCV, and have began developing code. We may choose
  to switch over to using python rather than C/C++ due to its simplicity and power. Overall our project is going well,
  and may end up being a simpler process than we previously thought.
  
  That paragraph is just a draft, please edit the shit out of it!
  I think the easiest way to evaluate our project would be accuracy and response time. It is pretty clear that a 
  Raspberry pi with its small camera wont be super high res and therefore acurate. I am VERY excited to get the PI
  working with some simple code to recognize faces. Maybe we can figure out a way to make it mobile so we can walk 
  around with and it try to build a repository of faces. We could add some sort of indicator light for when a face is
  recognized. Maybe we can get it to identify faces in real time and say when it saw that face last? 
  Just some ideas bouncing around my head.
